# GAN Architectures

Each file (besides this one) details the architecture behind the discriminator, generator, and full GAN (and q model in the case of the InfoGAN) for each type of GAN in the study. Here are is the "table of contents":

- [ACGAN](acgan_arch.md)
- [CGAN](cgan_arch.md)
- [GAN](gan_arch.md)
- [InfoGAN](infogan_arch.md)
- [SGAN](sgan_arch.md)


## Explanation of Model Summary

A sample model summary of the CGAN discriminator is shown below to describe what's really going on.
